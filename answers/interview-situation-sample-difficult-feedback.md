# Giving Difficult Feedback to Improve Team Performance

## Situation
A senior engineer on my team delivered strong technical work but frequently dismissed peer input, creating tension and slowing collaboration on shared services.

## Task
I needed to address the behavior directly, preserve trust, and improve team dynamics without losing momentum on critical deliverables.

## Action
I prepared specific examples, held a private feedback conversation focused on impact, and agreed on measurable behavior goals. I paired this with regular check-ins and opportunities for the engineer to lead collaborative design sessions.

## Result
Within two months, peer feedback scores improved significantly, planning discussions became faster and more constructive, and the engineer successfully led a cross-team architecture review.
