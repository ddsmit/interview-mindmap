# Coordinating a High-Severity Checkout Latency Incident

## Situation
During a holiday campaign, checkout latency spiked and conversions dropped. Multiple teams were involved, but no one had a shared view of root cause or ownership.

## Task
I was responsible for incident coordination, rapid stabilization, and communicating clear updates to leadership and support.

## Action
I established a war-room cadence, split investigation tracks by subsystem, and assigned decision owners for mitigation steps. I also set a 30-minute communication loop with support and exec stakeholders and documented a timeline in real time.

## Result
We restored normal latency within 90 minutes, recovered conversion performance the same day, and implemented follow-up fixes that prevented recurrence in later peak events.
