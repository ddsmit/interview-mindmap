# Optimizing Bug Triage to Improve Customer Experience

## Situation
“Our company prioritized customer satisfaction and Net Promoter Score, but we were consistently missing targets. Analysis revealed that customer dissatisfaction stemmed largely from long issue-resolution cycle times rather than defect severity.”

## Task
“I was responsible for identifying root causes of resolution delays and redesigning the process to materially improve customer experience without increasing headcount.”

## Action
“I analyzed the full issue lifecycle, examining intake quality, queue time, and resolution time. The data showed that delays were largely caused by misrouted or unassigned tickets rather than engineering resolution time.

I redesigned the intake process by developing clearer playbooks for technical support to improve issue categorization. We implemented automated routing using an agentic workflow to assign tickets directly to the correct development teams. I also partnered with leadership to emphasize training, tooling improvements, and knowledge management.”

## Result
“These changes reduced issue-resolution cycle time by 85%, significantly improving responsiveness and supporting NPS objectives. Quality was repositioned as a driver of customer experience and operational scalability rather than a back-end control function.”
