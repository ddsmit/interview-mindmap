# Making Scope Tradeoffs to Protect a Critical Launch Date

## Situation
My team was six weeks from launching a new onboarding flow when dependency delays put the target date at risk. Marketing had already committed publicly to the launch timeline.

## Task
I had to preserve the date while protecting core user value and reducing delivery risk.

## Action
I led a feature triage session, defined launch-critical versus post-launch scope, and negotiated phased delivery with partner teams. I reset expectations with stakeholders using a clear versioned rollout plan and risk register.

## Result
We launched on the original date with the highest-impact features, met adoption targets in the first month, and shipped deferred enhancements in the following sprint cycle.
