# Implementing Strategic Quality Capacity Planning

## Situation
“As NPI demand increased, quality support became reactive. Programs competed for limited resources, and leadership lacked visibility into whether we had sufficient quality capacity to support planned launches.”

## Task
“I was responsible for creating a forward-looking capacity model that would enable leadership to align quality resources with business priorities and risk.”

## Action
“I analyzed historical NPI workload data, quality effort by development phase, and projected program demand from the NPI roadmap. Using this data, I developed a capacity model translating program demand into quality workload requirements.

I presented the model to leadership as a planning and risk-management tool, enabling prioritization, timing adjustments, and resource allocation decisions based on objective data rather than assumptions.”

## Result
“Leadership gained clear visibility into quality capacity constraints and could proactively manage resource allocation. This reduced firefighting, improved NPI execution, and positioned Quality as a strategic partner in portfolio planning.”
