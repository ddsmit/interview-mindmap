# Aligning Conflicting Stakeholders on a Shared Product Roadmap

## Situation
At BrightPath, product, sales, and engineering had conflicting priorities for the next quarter. Deadlocks in planning meetings were delaying commitments to key enterprise customers.

## Task
I needed to align stakeholders on a roadmap that balanced customer demands with engineering capacity while preserving delivery confidence.

## Action
I interviewed each team lead to document non-negotiables, converted requests into impact-effort tradeoffs, and facilitated a decision workshop with clear prioritization criteria. I then published a single roadmap with owner-level commitments and monthly review checkpoints.

## Result
We reached alignment in one week, reduced roadmap churn by 45% over the quarter, and delivered all top-tier customer commitments on time.
