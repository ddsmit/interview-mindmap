# Establishing an Enterprise Quality Readiness Framework (QRL)

## Situation
“When I stepped into the role, senior leadership lacked a consistent way to assess program readiness across five distinct business units. Each operated differently, and readiness was being evaluated subjectively, often from a single-function lens. Leadership did not have a common view of risk across Quality, Engineering, Security, Compliance, and Regulatory.”

## Task
“I was tasked with creating a standardized, scalable framework that would allow leadership to objectively assess readiness across all business units and make data-driven decisions regarding program risk.”

## Action
“I approached the problem as an enterprise strategy initiative rather than a quality gate exercise.

I assembled a cross-functional team including Quality, Engineering, Security, Compliance, Regulatory, and Product Stewardship to evaluate the full NPI lifecycle. We defined maturity expectations aligned to each development phase and built a Quality Readiness Level (QRL) framework that assessed readiness across all core functions.

Importantly, I positioned the QRL as a leadership decision-support tool rather than a quality-owned checklist. As we deployed the framework, we analyzed readiness data to identify systemic gaps and partnered with functional leaders to close those gaps.”

## Result
“The QRL became the enterprise standard for program readiness assessment across all five business units. Leadership gained objective visibility into risk and could proactively intervene.

One notable outcome was identifying deficiencies in marketing requirements. By partnering with the Marketing Director, we implemented a structured requirements framework that improved upstream alignment and reduced downstream risk. The organization shifted from subjective readiness discussions to data-driven governance.”
