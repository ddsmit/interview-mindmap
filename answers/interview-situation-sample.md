# Leading a Payment System Migration Under Tight Deadlines

## Situation
At Acme Corp, our legacy payment gateway began failing during peak traffic and caused delayed customer transactions. This happened two months before a major seasonal sales event.

## Task
I was responsible for leading a cross-functional effort to migrate our checkout flow to a new payment provider without disrupting ongoing customer purchases.

## Action
I created a phased rollout plan, aligned engineering and support teams on daily checkpoints, and implemented feature flags so we could shift traffic gradually. I also built monitoring dashboards and a rollback protocol so we could react quickly if error rates increased.

## Result
We completed the migration one week ahead of schedule, reduced payment failure rates by 38%, and handled peak-season volume with no major incidents.
