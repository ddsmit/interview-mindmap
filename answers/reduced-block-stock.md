# Reducing Blocked Inventory Through Supplier Alignment

## Situation
“As Quality Manager at Atlas Copco, we were carrying significant blocked inventory that was impacting cash flow and operational efficiency. A Pareto analysis revealed that canopies accounted for approximately 60% of the blocked stock, primarily due to paint defects.”

## Task
“I was accountable for reducing blocked inventory while maintaining clear quality standards and improving supplier alignment.”

## Action
“I conducted a deeper analysis of nonconformance data and invited the supplier to participate in a Gemba walk to review rejected material firsthand.

During discussions, we uncovered two systemic issues: the supplier was not consistently receiving nonconformance notifications, and there was ambiguity regarding acceptable versus unacceptable defects.

I collaborated with Materials Planning, Operations, Logistics, and the supplier to develop visual boundary charts clearly defining allowable defects. We also corrected the supplier notification system to ensure timely communication and enable structured 8D corrective actions.

Using the agreed criteria, we sorted inventory, returned true defects, and responsibly reintroduced acceptable material into stock.”

## Result
“We significantly reduced blocked inventory, improved material flow, and strengthened supplier relationships. The process replaced disagreement and ambiguity with clarity and shared accountability, establishing a more mature supplier quality system.”
