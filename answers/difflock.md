# Eliminating a Long-Standing First Pass Yield Issue

## Situation
“Our organization was consistently missing first-pass yield targets due to failures at an end-of-line differential lock test. The issue drove significant rework and overtime costs and had persisted for over five years, becoming normalized within the process.”

## Task
“I was responsible for leading a structured investigation to identify and eliminate the root cause permanently, restoring process stability and reducing recurring cost.”

## Action
“I led a Six Sigma project using the DMAIC methodology and formed a cross-functional team including Manufacturing Engineering, Operations, and frontline operators.

Through structured analysis and design of experiments, we discovered that test limits had been periodically adjusted to manage symptoms rather than address the underlying issue. We ultimately identified that the engineering drawing specified straightness when the functional requirement should have been flatness. Because of the part’s geometry, it could never consistently meet the original specification.

I worked with Engineering to update the drawing and aligned with the supplier to meet the revised requirement.”

## Result
“We achieved 100% first-pass yield for that issue, eliminating recurring rework and saving thousands of dollars per month. Beyond the financial impact, the organization shifted from tolerating workarounds to expecting data-driven, permanent solutions.”
