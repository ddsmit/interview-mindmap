# Driving Cross-Functional FMEA Ownership in New Product Introduction

## Situation
“When I joined Itron, the organization was looking to strengthen its new product introduction process. I quickly identified that FMEAs—particularly DFMEAs—were inconsistent, completed too late to influence design decisions, and largely viewed as a ‘quality-owned’ activity.  

There was limited organizational competency, R&D did not feel accountable for design FMEAs, Manufacturing Engineering was disengaged, and the overall maturity of risk management within NPI was low.”

## Task
“I was responsible for elevating the effectiveness of FMEAs within NPI by increasing cross-functional ownership, building internal competency, and ensuring these risk assessments were completed early enough to proactively mitigate design and manufacturing risk.”

## Action
“I approached this as an organizational mindset and capability shift, not just a documentation gap.

First, I reframed Quality’s role from ‘owner’ to facilitator and enabler, clearly communicating that Design Engineering owned DFMEAs and Manufacturing owned PFMEAs.  

Second, I rolled out targeted training for Quality Engineers to strengthen their facilitation skills, ensuring they could effectively guide technical discussions without assuming ownership.  

Third, I embedded FMEA expectations into core team meetings and updated the product launch checklist to require FMEAs earlier in the development lifecycle. This made risk identification a structured, gate-driven requirement rather than an optional exercise.

While I initially encountered resistance—primarily due to discomfort and lack of perceived value—I focused on demonstrating impact. In early sessions, we identified high-risk failure modes and implemented meaningful mitigations that were eye-opening for the teams. Those early wins shifted the narrative from compliance-driven activity to value-generating risk management.”

## Result
“As a result, FMEA adoption and maturity increased significantly across teams. Manufacturing Engineers began actively participating and ultimately leading FMEA sessions. Ownership shifted away from Quality and into the functions where it belonged.

The organization became more proactive in identifying and mitigating risk earlier in the NPI cycle, strengthening product launch readiness and cross-functional collaboration. Over time, the improved FMEA discipline became a normalized part of the operating model, elevating overall NPI execution capability.”
